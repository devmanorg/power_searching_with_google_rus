Это урок 1.6.
Мы будем разговаривать о том, как использовать функцию "Найти".
Не функцию "Поиск в Google", а "Найти", чтобы сделать ваш поиск эффективнее и лучше.
Вот в чём дело:
Представьте себе, что вы оказались на очень длинной странице - как вы знаете, такое иногда случается. Вы оказываетесь на очень длинной странице, и хотите найти что-то на ней.
Например, представьте себе, что недавно вы участвовали в местном забеге на 8 километров.
Я недавно в таком участвовал. И я хочу на этой странице найти свой результат.
Вот как выглядит страница:
(TODO screenshot 00:38)
Просто длинный-длинный список людей и времени, за которое они пробежали, и их реально много.
Так как же мне найти моё время?
Просто искать по строкам - очень долго.
И легко ошибиться - их очень много.
Как сделать это легче?
Давайте покажу.

Во всех современных браузерах есть так называемая функция "Найти".
Она позволяет вам найти в открытом документе кусок текста.
Во всех браузерах вы можете нажать CMD+F (Mac) или CTRL+F (PC или аналог).
(TODO screenshot 01:24)

В любом случае вы делаете смешное движение двумя пальцами, нажимая сразу две клавиши.
Зажимаете пальцем CMD (или CTRL) и другим пальцем жмёте на F, а потом отпускаете обе клавиши.
Как следствие - появится маленькое окошко, в которое можно ввести текст, который вы хотите найти на странице.

Вот страница с результатами забега, на которой мы хотим найти данные.
Я на Mac в Google Chrome, поэтому я нажму CMD+F.
В правом верхнем углу появилось прямоугольное окно.
Теперь я введу своё имя - russel. Обратите внимание, строчные или прописные буквы - не важно.






1
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:35,059
that  allows you to   search   through that 

1
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,629
text finding the text you're looking for

1
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,340
 so here's an example   here's that long 

1
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,548
text document  I was talking about 

1
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,310
 earlier the results from the 8k   race 

1
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:48,350
here we are this is  the race page what 

1
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,719
I'm going to  do is type command F 

1
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:53,538
because I'm on a Macintosh running

1
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:56,899
Chrome  command F and you   see this   thing 

1
00:01:53,539 --> 00:02:01,218
 that pops up here that was   the previous 

1
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,019
 search so I'm going to go back this   is 

1
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,149
 the page we want to search for this is 

1
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:07,218
 that page of all   the results   so what I'm 

1
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,060
 going to do since I'm on a Macintosh is 

1
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:11,180
type  command 

1
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,699
 F watch this command F and the box 

1
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,080
appears in  the upper right corner so now 

1
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:17,719
I'm  going to type in my   name 

1
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,760
 ru SSE LL   and notice it's not 

1
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,740
case-sensitive here  and if you look 

1
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,689
carefully you'll see  that there   this is 

1
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,000
one of  four so let's go down and find 

1
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:28,489
the highlighted text  and there it is 

1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,289
Russell  notice that the case is   not the 

1
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,409
same but  that's   alright this is case 

1
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:36,318
 insensitive   now that's not me I'm Dan 

1
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,729
 that's my son as it turns out so what 

1
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,219
I'm going to do is click  on this down 

1
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:43,099
arrow or  hit   enter it does the same 

1
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:45,650
 thing   it   goes to the next found text   in 

1
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,469
this  case   I'm   gonna   hit enter/return   and 

1
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:52,129
it finds  my name as you can see Daniel 

1
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:54,949
Russell and this  is my entry here and 

1
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,889
that's my  time so notice though that   it 

1
00:02:54,949 --> 00:03:01,189
says up here  that there are four hits on 

1
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,899
this text  Russell in this document so I 

1
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,539
 can use these   arrows that   go down to the 

1
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,310
 next one which is   now in a age bracket 

1
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:09,829
group for my son or a different age

1
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,469
bracket group for me  and so now   we   see 

1
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,230
 all the different instances   of   the term 

1
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:17,900
that we were looking  for it's worth 

1
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,810
knowing that  this same trick this 

1
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,390
 control F command   F find function is 

1
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,599
different on  different browsers   so for 

1
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:28,939
 example in Firefox   the the   fine box will 

1
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,060
 appear in the lower left corner way down 

1
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,799
here now you see  just like in   Chrome you 

1
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,500
got the up to go  to the previous 

1
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,079
instance  and down to go to the next 

1
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,750
 instance on the page basically move up 

1
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,760
move down to each of  that peak instances 

1
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,799
of the text you're looking for you  can 

1
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,019
 also click on this highlight all button 

1
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,480
 to automatically highlight all   of the 

1
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:53,530
instances  of them page so that's Firefox 

1
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,389
 lower left corner if you're using Safari 

1
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,739
 the fine box appears in the upper right 

1
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,229
 you can see this here 

1
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,819
again they  can go forward   or back that's 

1
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,289
what the left and right arrows are it

1
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,409
tells you how many  matches you'll you 

1
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:08,179
have  and if you're in   Chrome   the same 

1
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:10,250
kind of thing here we've got some

1
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,090
 results   we can   go up and down it tells 

1
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,668
you the total  number of instances found 

1
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,410
in Internet Explorer  9 it's in the upper 

1
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:22,129
left so yeah I know we've got  one in the 

1
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,990
lower left upper left upper right pay

1
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,050
 attention   to your browser you need to 

1
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,759
know what your browser does in this  case 

1
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,629
 but an Internet Explorer   9 it appears 

1
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,969
 upper left corner 

1
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,918
 again they have previous and next to go 

1
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,450
forward and  back   in the document   total 

1
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,449
 number of matches   and different   options 

1
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:41,120
 including the option to match the case 

1
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,399
 so as I   showed you   in Chrome 

1
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
I had  case-insensitive here you could 

1
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,000
 turn case sensitivity on if you wanted 

1
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,610
to  here I'm on the Wikipedia   page for 

1
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,220
 the Summer Olympic athletics events and 

1
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,740
what I'm curious about is  to find how do 

1
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,830
you  say in   bolt   two so what I'm going to 

1
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,780
do is type command  F and   you see the 

1
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,959
thing popped up there and I'm  going to 

1
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:05,599
 type   the name Usain   because that's an 

1
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,029
unusual  name and you can see here we 

1
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,610
already know we  have eight instances   of 

1
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:12,439
the  word you saying   on this page and if 

1
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,240
 you look   on the right-hand side   you   see 

1
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,759
 the little yellow   bars   there and the 

1
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,038
scroll bar you can  see   all eight 

1
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,349
positions in the long document where

1
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,259
this word occurs so you can see over

1
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,970
 here   the browser has highlighted his 

1
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,788
name and if we skip down a little bit

1
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,380
I'm going  to scroll up now you see the 

1
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,449
the scroll bar up here  and I'm going to 

1
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,759
move it down  to   the next group of 

1
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:37,939
instances  and   there we go   we have   three 

1
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,699
instances  of Usain Bolt's name   one two 

1
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,189
 three corresponding to   these three 

1
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,199
yellow lines and the  scroll bar this is 

1
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,629
nice because you  can now see how those 

1
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,399
terms appear throughout the entire

1
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:52,069
document  that sometimes   really handy 

1
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,799
thing  to know   so why do you need to know 

1
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,529
 this a couple of reasons first off 

1
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,199
knowing how  to find your   search term   on 

1
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,750
the page really  speeds   up your   search in 

1
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,930
our studies we found  that it speeds up 

1
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,000
 this we found that it speeds up the   rate 

1
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,939
at which people  search by roughly   12% 

1
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,028
 and that's a huge amount   of time it's 

1
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:17,939
like  giving you   12% of your life back 

1
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:19,709
it also puts  you in the top   10%   because 

1
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,879
in our studies we've also found that

1
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:26,249
 about   90%   of everybody who uses   Google 

1
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,039
does  not know this trick so now that you 

1
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:30,539
know  this trick   you're in the top 10% 

1
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,949
 you'll be faster   and we also know from 

1
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:36,298
 other   studies you're gonna be more 

1
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:37,889
 accurate more efficient overall now the 

1
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:41,818
last  property is kind of the neatest one 

1
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,129
 of all because it will tell you using 

1
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,949
this control of command  F trick whether 

1
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:49,408
or not  a word appears   on the document   or 

1
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,199
not  think about   that   you can actually 

1
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,418
prove  that something   is   not on the 

1
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,489
document that's  a rare skill a rare 

1
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,158
ability  how   often   can you do that   in 

1
00:06:56,488 --> 00:07:01,288
life  so remember   this sometimes you can 

1
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:02,759
 use it to prove that for example a 

1
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,709
 person   never ran in that   race or at 

1
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,899
least was never  recorded you search for 

1
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:09,179
their  name in that   aka running race with 

1
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,088
 lists they're not there   they didn't run 

1
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:15,928
or they were  never written   down by the 

1
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:18,269
race recorders this overall trick is

1
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:21,418
 really handy to know and I   need you to 

1
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:24,629
have this  in your   toolbox so going 

1
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:26,758
forward this  is the   end of the first set 

1
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,229
 of lessons   for class number one we're 

1
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,479
looking forward  to   class number two 

1
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:32,488
 where   we will learn not   just how make 

1
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,618
 queries but how do   we interpret the 

1
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:37,609
results that understand what  it is 

1
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,610
 Google is trying   to   tell you
